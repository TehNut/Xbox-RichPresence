# Xbox Rich Presence for Discord

This program uses [XboxAPI](https://xboxapi.com/) to provide rich presence integration with Discord.

## Usage

Either via the command line:

`java -jar Xbox-RichPresence-X.Y.Z-all.jar $API_KEY $GAMERTAG $DISPLAYOFFLINE`

Or launch the jar without any args to get a GUI for settings. A json file for the GUI config
is stored in the working directory.

API key.
